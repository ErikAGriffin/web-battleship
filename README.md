<h1>Battleship</h1>
An online version of the classic game.

Unfortunately I did not have time to finish the online version during the course, perhaps I will come back to it later.
I enjoyed playing around with javascript and jquery to get the functionality I wanted of having the ships move hover with the mouse before being placed, although now I believe I could achieve a much better result with Angular.
